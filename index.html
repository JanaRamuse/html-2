           <h3>
             What is a Pekehund?
           </h3>
           <i>
             Pekehunds are a cute and curious mix between a Dachshund (aka “Doxie”) and Pekingese.
             <br> Several strong traits of both parents balance out in this hybrid,
             <br>such as energy level. However, other strong traits reinforce each other,
             <br>such as loyalty, intelligence, and people-orientation. Pekehunds vary widely in color,
             <br>as well as size and appearance depend on what type of Dachshund parent they have
             <br>(standard size, miniature, smooth-haired, long-haired, wire-haired). Generally, however,
             <br>they weight between 10 and 22 pounds and grow to be 7 to 9 inches tall. Though an adorable
             <br>combination, Pekehunds are less common than other Pekingese and Dachshund mixes and not yet
             <br>recognized by the American Kennel Association.
